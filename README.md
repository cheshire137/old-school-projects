These are a couple old school projects from 2010. I found the Git/Subversion
repos lying around and thought I would put them on Github.

## Project 1, 2010

A Ruby on Rails app for a databases class. I didn't use ActiveRecord, instead
writing my own SQL.

## Project 2, 2010

Another Ruby on Rails app without ActiveRecord.

## Project 3, 2007

A Ruby web application that's a fake Amazon-like site.
