I adopt the following convention: tables are listed as semicolon-separated data
(one of the attributes in one of the tables is numerical. I use in it comma,
thus it can not be used as a separator). The first line of the table is the
metadata (scheme). After the attribute name I list the attribute type.
I use * as a end-of-line separator.

The scenario is that the tables are created for a small private bank in
Switzerland. The table U_levels represents the security levels of analysts in
the bank (observe that tellers would have to have access to the attribute
"amount", and some users in our table Clients will not have such access, or
not a complete access.)

Table U_levels:

name:varchar;class:varchar*
alice;C*
baxter;TS*
dexter;S*
marek;C*

Table Clients

lname:varchar;lClass:varchar;fname:varchar;fClass:varchar;amount:numeric(7,2);aClass:varchar;jurisdiction:varchar;jclass:varchar*
al-gamal;C;selim;C;12,322.00;S;abu dhabi;S*
bosch;C;hendrik;C;14,073.00;C;netherlands;C*
ivanov;C;alexander;C;24,016.00;TS;russia;S*
schmidt;C;johann;C;22,400.32;TS;germany;S*
smith;C;john;C;15,000.17;S;australia;TS*


The test query:

SELECT lname, fname, jurisdiction FROM Clients WHERE amount BETWEEN 14,000 AND 20,000

The correct answer to the query asked by user marek:

 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 bosch | hendrik | netherlands
 smith | john    | NULL
